GREATER AND LESS THAN OPERATORS
-------------------------------------
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3
7   > '3'
2   >  3
'1' >  9

In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, true, false, and false.
Add the greater than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testGreaterThan(val) {
  if (val > 100) {  
    return "Over 100";
  }
  if (val > 10) {  
    return "Over 10";
  }
  return "10 or Under";
}
let result = testGreaterThan(10);
console.log(result);

The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6
7   >= '3'
2   >=  3
'7' >=  9

In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, true, false, and false.

Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
  if (val >= 20) { 
    return "20 or Over";
  }
  if (val >= 10) { 
    return "10 or Over";
  }
  return "Less than 10";
}

testGreaterOrEqual(10);

The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

2   < 5
'3' < 7
5   < 5
3   < 2
'8' < 4

In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, true, false, false, and false.

Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testLessThan(val) {
  if (val < 25) { 
    return "Under 25";
  }
  if (val < 55) { 
    return "Under 55";
  }
  return "55 or Over";
}
testLessThan(10);

The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples

4   <= 5
'7' <= 7
5   <= 5
3   <= 2
'8' <= 4

In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, true, true, false, and false.

Add the less than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testLessOrEqual(val) {
  if (val <= 12) {  // Change this line
    return "Smaller Than or Equal to 12";
  }
  if (val <= 24) {  // Change this line
    return "Smaller Than or Equal to 24";
  }
  return "More Than 24";
}
testLessOrEqual(10);
