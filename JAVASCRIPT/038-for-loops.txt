FOR LOOPS
-------------------------
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the intialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

ourArray will now have the value [0,1,2,3,4].

//Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop

For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers.

We'll start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

ourArray will now contain [0,2,4,6,8]. Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.

//Count Backwards With a For Loop.

A for loop can also count backwards, so long as we can define the right conditions.

In order to decrement by two each iteration, we'll need to change our initialization, condition, and final expression.

We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

var ourArray = [];
for (var i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

ourArray will now contain [10,8,6,4,2].

Task:
-------------------------
//1.Use a for loop to push the values 1 through 5 onto an array "myArray".

let myArray = [];
for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
console.log(myArray);


//2.Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.

let myArray = [];
for(let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
console.log(myArray);


//3.Push the even numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.

let myArray = [];
for(let i = 8; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
console.log(myArray);
