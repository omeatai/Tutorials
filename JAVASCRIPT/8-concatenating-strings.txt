CONCATENATING STRINGS
-------------------------
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";
ourStr now has a value of the string I come first. I come second.

Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

Example:

var ourName = "Ifeanyi";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is Ifeanyi, how are you?.

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

Example:

var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

Question:
-------------------------
#1.Build myStr from the strings "This is the start." and "This is the end." using concatenation. Be sure to include a space between the two strings.

#2.Build myStr over several lines by concatenating these two strings: 'This is the first sentence.' and 'This is the second sentence.' using the += operator. Be sure to include a space between the two strings. Start by assigning the first string to myStr, then add on the second string.

#3.Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings 'My name is' and 'and I am well!'

#4.Set 'someAdjective' to a string of at least 3 characters and append it to 'myStr'.

-------------------------
Solution:
-------------------------
#1
let myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";

#2
let myStr = "This is the first sentence. "; myStr += "This is the second sentence.";

#3
var myName = "Ifeanyi Omeata"; var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";

#4
var someAdjective;
var someAdjective = "fantastic"; var myStr = "Learning to code is "; myStr += someAdjective;
