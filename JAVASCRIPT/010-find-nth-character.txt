FIND FIRST CHARACTER
-------------------------
Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

Example:

let firstName = "Charles";
let firstLetter = firstName[0];
firstLetter would have a value of the string C.

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Ada", you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].

Example:

var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
lastLetter would have a value of the string a.

You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the var firstName = "Augusta" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Example:

var firstName = "Augusta";
var thirdToLastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 3];
thirdToLastLetter would have a value of the string s.

Question:
-------------------------
#1
let lastName = "Lovelace";
Use bracket notation to find the first character in the lastName variable and assign it to firstLetterOfLastName.

#2
let lastName = "Lovelace";
Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

#3
let lastName = "Lovelace";
Use bracket notation to find the last character in the lastName variable.

#4
let lastName = "Lovelace";
Use bracket notation to find the second-to-last character in the lastName string.

-------------------------
Solution:
-------------------------
#1
let firstLetterOfLastName = "";
let lastName = "Lovelace";
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];

#2
let lastName = "Lovelace";
let thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

#3
let lastName = "Lovelace";
let lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];

#4
let lastName = "Lovelace";
let secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
