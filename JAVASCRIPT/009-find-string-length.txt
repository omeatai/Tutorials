FIND STRING LENGTH
-------------------------
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console.

For example, if we created a variable let firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.
